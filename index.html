    <title>Happy 29th Birthday</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Hello dear Ahad Aman Sheikh (or Almeida, don't want to mess with your preferences),</p>
    <p>This is an official email to congratulate you on successfully surviving and thriving the entirety of 29 years. Let's skip the lies, former - fully, latter - MOST of the time (humans tend to deviate from the mean sometimes and that's okay). I have sent you a Bezos-branded package* with a very special powder mix. Worry not - legal and not controversial!!! Although, I would refrain from bragging about your 'mushroom tea' too loudly on the streets or in the office if I were you. But hey, do you know about the magic this pack contains? Pick one: YES / NO, and proceed further depending on your answer:</p>
    <p>If NO:<br>
       - Red Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) - mushroom of immortality, helps balance the immune system and defend against the negative effects of aging.<br>
       - Cordyceps sinensis - boosts Vo2MAX, increases exercise endurance, and supports muscle recovery.<br>
       - Chaga (Inonotus Obliquus) - one of the best medicinal mushrooms for antioxidant support and healthy aging.<br>
       - Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) - by stimulating NGF, lion’s mane can protect against diseases like multiple sclerosis and dementia while improving cognitive function and fighting anxiety symptoms.<br>
       - Shiitake (Lentinus edodes) - for a healthy heart.<br>
       - Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) - stimulates your body’s natural killer cells (against cancer).<br>
       - Maitake (Grifola frondosa) - balances blood sugar levels to manage type-2 diabetes.<br>
       - Agaricus Blazei Murrill - is used to fight physical and emotional stress, stimulate the immune system.</p>
    <p>Else (you don't know, go back to the question): Well too late, you were meant to read the health benefits regardless. Thank you for participating in the Yes or No game.</p>
    <p>But what is Ahad meant to do with this powder you ask?<br>
       Just 2 grams (or less than half a teaspoon) for any hot or cold drink you want to make, however, I recommend for it to be a hot one. Specifically, a mushroom-infused special Sunday** morning chocolatey coffee (MHMMMM-MHMMMM). After all, you brought the entire coffee machine to the UAE, so let's make use of it.</p>
    <p>Let's start with a visual - here is how the current LLM version 4 by Sam Altman*** envisioned your ritual to look like *insert drum piece here*:</p>

    <p>How to: whisk dry ingredients, add wet ingredients but leave the milk out, whisk them up, use it as coffee base and pour steamed milk as you would for a regular latte.</p>
    <h2>BONUS RECIPE (OMG WHAT, what a TREAT!!!!!)</h2>
    <p>Mushroom Hot Cocoa Latte<br>
       1 tsp mushroom powder<br>
       1 tsp maple syrup<br>
       1 tsp almond butter (optional / or other nut / seed butter)<br>

       1 cup dairy-free milk (cashew, coconut, almond milk or beef milk even)</p>
    <p>How to: same, but blend up the almond butter with all the ingredients but the steamed milk, pour milk last as you would normally.</p>
    <p>Happy happy birthday, you rabbit!! Wish I could send some natural rain your way. Enjoy the desert and the scary thunderstorms!</p>
    <p>Best,<br>You know who (no 'x' will be sent from me ever)</p>
    <p>* P.s. I always want to say 'little' in front of everything, I've learnt this from you, the sentence above originally read as '..a little package..'.<br>
       ** P.s.s. Not strictly Sunday, but this just sounded better.<br>
       *** P.s.s. He got sued by Elon Musk, look it up, kinda serious but fun.</p>
