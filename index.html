    <p>Hello dear Ahad Aman Sheikh (or Almeida, don't want to mess with your preferences),</p>
    <p>This is an official email to congratulate you on successfully surviving and thriving the entirety of 29 years. Let's skip the lies, former - fully, latter - MOST of the time (humans tend to deviate from the mean sometimes and that's okay). I have sent you a <span class="bolditalic">Bezos-branded package*</span> with a very special powder mix. Worry not - <span class="bold">legal and not controversial!!!</span> Although, I would refrain from bragging about your 'mushroom tea' too loudly on the streets or in the office if I were you. But hey, do you know about the magic this pack contains? Pick one: <span class="italic">YES / NO</span>, and proceed further depending on your answer:</p>
    <p>If <span class="bold">NO</span>:<br>
        - <span class="bold">Red Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)</span> - mushroom of immortality, helps balance the immune system and defend against the negative effects of aging.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Cordyceps sinensis</span> - boosts Vo2MAX, increases exercise endurance, and supports muscle recovery.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Chaga (Inonotus Obliquus)</span> - one of the best medicinal mushrooms for antioxidant support and healthy aging.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus)</span> - by stimulating NGF, lion’s mane can protect against diseases like multiple sclerosis and dementia while improving cognitive function and fighting anxiety symptoms.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Shiitake (Lentinus edodes)</span> - for a healthy heart.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor)</span> - stimulates your body’s natural killer cells (against cancer).<br>
        - <span class="bold">Maitake (Grifola frondosa)</span> - balances blood sugar levels to manage type-2 diabetes.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Agaricus Blazei Murrill</span> - is used to fight physical and emotional stress, stimulate the immune system.</p>
    <p>Else (you don't know, go back to the question): Well too late, you were meant to read the health benefits regardless. Thank you for participating in the Yes or No game.</p>
    <p>But what is Ahad meant to do with this powder you ask?<br>
       Just 2 grams (or less than half a teaspoon) for any hot or cold drink you want to make, however, I recommend for it to be a hot one. Specifically, a mushroom-infused special Sunday** morning chocolatey coffee (MHMMMM-MHMMMM). After all, you brought the entire coffee machine to the UAE, so let's make use of it.</p>
    <p>Let's start with a visual - here is how the current LLM version 4 by Sam Altman*** envisioned your ritual to look like *insert drum piece here*:</p>
    <img src="image.webp" alt="Mushroom Chocolatey Coffee Latte Visual">
    <h2>The official recipe:</h2>
    <p>Mushroom Chocolatey Coffee Latte<br>
       1 tsp mushroom powder<br>
       1 tsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)<br>
       1 tsp cacao powder (not optional)<br>
       1 pinch ground cinnamon<br>
       1 pinch sea salt<br>
       1 cup milk (cashew, coconut, almond milk or beef milk even)<br>
       1 shot espresso</p>
    <p>How to: whisk dry ingredients, add wet ingredients but leave the milk out, whisk them up, use it as coffee base and pour steamed milk as you would for a regular latte.</p>
    <h2>BONUS RECIPE (OMG WHAT, what a TREAT!!!!!)</h2>
    <p>Mushroom Hot Cocoa Latte<br>
       1 tsp mushroom powder<br>
       1 tsp maple syrup<br>
       1 tsp almond butter (optional / or other nut / seed butter)<br>
       2 Tbsp cacao powder<br>
       1 pinch ground cinnamon<br>
       1 pinch sea salt<br>
       1 cup dairy-free milk (cashew, coconut, almond milk or beef milk even)</p>
    <p>How to: same, but blend up the almond butter with all the ingredients but the steamed milk, pour milk last as you would normally.</p>
    <p>Happy happy birthday, you rabbit!! Wish I could send some natural rain your way. Enjoy the desert and the scary thunderstorms!</p>
    <p>Best,<br>You know who (no 'x' will be sent from me ever)</p>
    <p>* P.s. I always want to say 'little' in front of everything, I've learnt this from you, the sentence above originally read as '..a little package..'.<br>
       ** P.s.s. Not strictly Sunday, but this just sounded better.<br>
       *** P.s.s. He got sued by Elon Musk, look it up, kinda serious but fun.</p>
