    <p>Hello dear <strong>Ahad Aman Sheikh (or Almeida,</strong>don't want to mess with your preferences),</p>
    <p>This is an official email to congratulate you on successfully surviving and thriving the entirety of 29 years. Let's skip the lies, former - fully, latter - MOST of the time (humans tend to deviate from the mean sometimes and that's okay).</p>
    <p>Can we just quickly make something super clear? I haven't seen you in over 2 months. Here is how I imagine your morning routine:</p>
    <img src="image2.webp" alt="Ahad before">
    <p>But so what? Well. It's all looking great. Can we improve...? Always.</p>
    <p>I have sent you a <span class="bolditalic">Bezos-branded package*</span> with a very special powder mix. Worry not - <span class="bold">legal and not controversial!!!</span> Although, I would refrain from bragging about your 'mushroom tea' too loudly on the streets or in the office if I were you. But hey, do you know about the magic this pack contains? Pick one: <span class="bolditalic">YES / NO</span>, and proceed further depending on your answer:</p>
    <p>If <span class="bold">NO</span>:<br>
        - <span class="bold">Red Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)</span> - mushroom of immortality, helps balance the immune system and defend against the negative effects of aging.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Cordyceps sinensis</span> - boosts Vo2MAX, increases exercise endurance, and supports muscle recovery.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Chaga (Inonotus Obliquus)</span> - one of the best medicinal mushrooms for antioxidant support and healthy aging.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus)</span> - by stimulating NGF, lion’s mane can protect against diseases like multiple sclerosis and dementia while improving cognitive function and fighting anxiety symptoms.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Shiitake (Lentinus edodes)</span> - for a healthy heart.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor)</span> - stimulates your body’s natural killer cells (against cancer).<br>
        - <span class="bold">Maitake (Grifola frondosa)</span> - balances blood sugar levels to manage type-2 diabetes.<br>
        - <span class="bold">Agaricus Blazei Murrill</span> - is used to fight physical and emotional stress, stimulate the immune system.</p>
    <p>If <span class="bold">YES</span> (you don't know, go back to the question): <p>
    <p>Well too late, you were meant to read the health benefits regardless. Thank you for participating in the Yes or No game.</p>
    <p>But what is Ahad meant to do with this powder you ask?<br>
        Just 2 grams (or less than half a teaspoon) for any hot or cold drink you want to make, however, I recommend for it to be a hot one. Specifically, a <span class="bolditalic">mushroom-infused special Sunday** morning chocolatey coffee</span> (MHMMMM-MHMMMM). After all, you brought the entire coffee machine to the UAE, so let's make use of it.</p>
    <p>Let's start with a visual - here is how the current LLM version 4 by Sam Altman*** envisioned your ritual to look *insert drum piece here*:</p>
